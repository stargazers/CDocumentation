==============

	Description:
		PHP Class for parsing PHP files which have Doxygen like
		comment blocks. This class is a helper class so we can create
		a document generator which read comment blocks from PHP files
		and creates a documentations.

		Notice that this class is NOT meant to be as flexible as
		a Doxygen is. This class works for my commenting style and
		it is not meant to work with every different ways. So, this
		basically works only when you have commenting style like this:

			// ******************************************************
			// someFunction
			/*!
				@brief Function that will create something.

				@param $x This is the first parameter.

				@param $y And here is another parameter.

				@return Array
			*/
			// ******************************************************
			public function someFunction( $x, $y )
			{

			}

		Reason why I wrote this class was because I needed a documentation
		generator from PHP files which uses Doxygen-like style but
		does not require any application installations on servers.
